### MASTERMIND

#### High-level project plan:

1. Build all project requirements locally, test, run, and initate final Pull Request so both partners have the final version within local repos.
2. Move final main branch to Replit interface
  - Option to 'test' a limited interface, to avoid back-tracking or reengineering features that run locally but not within Replit.
3. Proposed Git worflow:  Git init from main branch, new branch for `testing`, and each dragon pushes features completed to remote, so that each alligator can pull those features down for next iteration.
