# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template when conducting DTR with your project partners.

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
  - Ensure we both understand each other's unique approaches, to make all concepts 100% concrete and understood.
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
  - N/A:  Practice of dragon/alligator will be critical, per instructions.
  - General rule of thumb:  Work section-by-section, or hour-by-hour (i.e. if stuck), to ensure a regular cadence of rotation, for fresh perspective.
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
  - Honesty is always the best policy -- try the "time out" approach, if stuck or looking for more clarification, looking to interject an idea, etc, "time out" is a full stop queue to step back and ensure we are on the same page.
  - Full clarification and rationale behind feedback is critical to mutual understanding.
* How would you describe your work style?
  - Working ahead is the team goal.
  - Schedules generally align (adjusted for time zone); best work time is after dinner.  Critical to maintain transparency in adjustment of schedule (+/-) as needed
  - Initial POM break cadence target:  50 on / 10 off?
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
  - Taylor:  Technical knowledge and prior programming experience.
  - Caroline:  Very hard working, eager to learn and understand.  Great resource to de-stress!
* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
  - Caroline:  Time management (too much time helping others in last project detracted from overall project work time)
  - Taylor:  Over-engineering features, could make leaner syntax for a more efficient program.  Try to stick to the books a bit more on this one.
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
  - Explore the concepts, theory, approach, and ensure mutual understanding prior to just "jumping in to the code."
  - Joint decision-making, open and honest feedback, and transparency will maintain a well functioning team.
* How will we overcome obstacles?
  - "Time out" if we need to slow down.
  - "Gut check" each component before moving on to the next, to ensure mutual understanding.
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
  - Good working environments, as long as we are making good use of scheduled project work time, we should be okay.
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
  - Ideal work time is 6:30/7:00 (latest) - 9:30/10:00 (latest) MT
  - Ideal work time is 8:30/9:00 (latest) - 11:30/12:00 (latest) ET
  - Project check-in on 5/20, to game plan for weekend / early next week work time.
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
  - Honesty is always the best policy!  "Time out" can be applied in this scenario too (i.e. if a de-stress sesh is needed)
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
  - Taylor:  Flow control, and logical statements. In both a programming and non-programming context, breaking down problems into logical discrete components to solve them.  Area of improvement is sticking more to the books, to engineer simpler solutions.
  - Caroline:  Visual learner, practical and hands-on learner.  Area of improvement is better understanding of order of operations in implementing a solution.
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
  - Github workflow proposal:  Taylor initiates repo locally, creates new branch, pushes to remote; Caroline pulls remote to local.  Each partner will flip/flop dragon/alligator on a per-feature/per-hour basis, as appropriate.
  - Commit frequently, to ensure progress is logically tracked and recoverable in the event of a local system failure.
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
  - "Time out" in the event a solution isn't mutually understood.
  - Lead with probing questions to ensure we can both explain concepts to each other, to ensure full understanding of the implemented solution.
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
  - Meets all requirements as listed in the instructions and rubric
  - Follow best practices of TDD, to ensure all methods are appropriately tested.
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
  - Celebrate wins as a part of the routine "gut check" process.
  - Caroline's project mantra:  "Aim for progress, not perfection."
  - Taylor's project mantra:  "Done is better than perfect."
  - Team mantra:  "STAY POSITIVE!!!"

Any additional questions that you would like to add:

### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
 - Solid work environments, transparency is key if anything is becoming distracting (i.e. random background noise).
* When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?
  - Life happens, transparency is key to adjust schedules as needed based on current status.
* If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.
  - Slack is number 1 for quick communication; meetings coordinated over Google Calendar and Zoom.
  - Alternative wifi available, in the event someone goes dark.
* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
  - Initial proposal:  50 on / 10 off.
* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
  - 5 minute check in at the beginning of a work session, for a temperature check.
  - Be open and honest if a break is needed (especially for snacks!!)

### Template for DTR Memo

Project: MASTERMIND

Group Member Names: Caroline Tan, Taylor Varoglu

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):  Ensure we mutually understand our approach and solution.  Learning together and winning together = success!

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):  Hard-working, process-oriented, and open communication will provide a safe, understanding, and positive work environment.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:  Leading each other to grasp concepts collectively; use of practical examples to reinforce concepts.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):  Evening blocks coordinated to work collectively.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):  Daily communication over Slack and scheduled work time to iterate scheduling constraints and project approach as needed.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):  Striving to create an elegant, yet simple solution to the problem; strengthening flow control and order of operations to make a stable solution.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):  N/A - dragon/alligator proposed approach for all features.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):  Commit early and often, to ensure work is not lost; separate branches for each dragon, to make pull requests and project integration simple to track.

Pomodoro Break Schedule:  50 on / 10 off (to start)

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:  Early and often - full transparency is key.

Additional Remote Considerations:  Time zone difference; possible background distractions.

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):  Initial proposal to make a checklist in root directory ReadMe.

Day 1 Agenda:
[x] Complete DTR!
[ ] Whiteboard high-level project components / solution
[ ] Brainstorm individually during dinner/house work break(s)
[ ] Begin project implementation during the first evening working session

Additional Notes:  Revisit DTR as needed, to modify template for current project tracking purposes, and reference for future projects.
